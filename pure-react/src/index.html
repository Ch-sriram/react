        We are going to add in the div that we first saw in 
        index.html file after we ran create-react-app command.
        That div is known with the id of "root".
     -->
    <div id="root">React NOT Rendered!</div>

    <!-- 
        In index.js file (from when we create the react app 
        using create-react-app command), we render the <App/> 
        component on the "root" div, and to do that same 
        thing, what we do is, we import React and ReactDOM 
        javascript files into our app.
        
        We are going to include the 2 packages React and 
        ReactDOM using the <script> tag using the "unpkg 
        react" and "unpkg react-dom" (google them) CDN links 
        from: https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html
     -->
     <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    
    <!-- 
        Now we've both React and ReactDOM packages ready for 
        use in our project. But why do we need both the 
        packages?
        
        The thing is, the package for React is just the API, but the package that is actually used to render elements out to the the DOM is ReactDOM, and the reason for this is that, React is kind of like an view-engine, which means that, we can have same kind of engine for many different kind of views.
        
        Different views => ReactDOM is for Web, ReactNative is for Native Android/iOS Mobile Applications, React360 is used to build 3D/VR Apps.
        
        All of the sub-packages use the React package as the base package as a view-engine of sorts.
     -->

    <!-- 
        Whenever we render the <App/> component from index.js, 
        we replace the content inside the "root" div with 
        whatever React produces in the <App/> component.

        Now, if we run this file without rendering any 
        components on to the "root" div, we'll see in the 
        Chrome Dev Console that we have access to the React 
        and ReactDOM objects/classes in our global javascript 
        namespace, and this is pretty much what we do when we 
        import in React from "react" and ReactDOM from 
        "react-dom" into our .jsx/.js files.

        Now, we'll add our own script tag and inside that, 
        we'll write javascript, which is rendered after the 
        jsx gets compiled internally by react.

        called internally by react to actually create the
