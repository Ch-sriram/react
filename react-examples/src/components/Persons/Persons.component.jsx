 * READ THE FOLLOWING AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE!!
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * 
 * We can clearly see that the Persons component is not
 * rendered again from scratch because shouldComponentUpdate 
 * returns a false value based on the condition that the state
 * of the Persons component didn't change.
 * 
 * Now, the Persons component has nothing to do with Cockpit
 * component and so, this is the optimization we are talking 
 * about, which is possible in React.
 * 
 * Although, all of these changes are only internal, in the 
 * sense that these are optimizations done at the Virtual DOM
 * level. The updation(s) of the real DOM is still done w/o
 * needing this internal check, in an extremely optimized way.
 * 
 * But this internal checking of the component whether React
 * should even go and check this particular component to be 
 * rendered or not, we can even handle that using the 
 * shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method.
