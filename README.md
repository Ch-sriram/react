# React &mdash; Proof of Concept

In this repository, I've implemented (or implementing) all the concepts related to React and its related technologies (like Redux, Context API & GraphQL) through making an E-commerce website. Please feel free to go through this repository for your own learning/revision as I'll be doing the same if I ever need to revise/reinforce my knowledge on React (or it's related technologies).
